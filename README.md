## Pre-Project Idea Summary
The VirtualCoach Training Meet app is designed to streamline the process of organizing and managing swim meets for the purpose of training for coaches of all level. 
The application allows users to register swimmers, assign them to events and heats, and track results in a streamlined package.

This project was insired by personal experience as a member of a college swim team, having helped in run a few meets in the past. The app is based off the existing professional software, MeetManager, which provides a more extensive and detailed approach to directing a meet. The intent of this project is to create a more user-friendly, barebones version of the software that allows less those less experienced in MeetManager to set up swim meets. This should allow coaches of all levels to easily design "mock meets" to use as a training tool, without needing to bring in outside assistance if they are unfamiliar with the more complex software.
